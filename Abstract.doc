Abstract:

The potential for robotic applications in the industrial manufacturing field is increasing day by day. A more recent focus has been on grasping devices for 
material handling. The purpose of our work is to investigate a potential approach to getting around the present constraints on the robotic solutions already 
in use for selecting items in cluttered settings. In computerized production businesses, pick-and-place tasks are fundamentally important. Bin-picking is one 
of the most common starting phase jobs in industrial operations. The difficulty lies in handling mixed bins containing various components with complicated 
configurations in a more flexible manner. Without having to make any changes to the hardwareâ€™s structure or design, businesses can manage a wide variety of 
components by using clever autonomous robots to select various types of items. The robot sorts the item or chooses it based on the description after using 
object detection to determine its hue, depth, and form. We propose a software design of a robotic pick-and-place system embedded with preliminary computer 
vision abilities to execute various haptic-based tasks such as pick-and-place and sorting. The entire project is built on Robotic Operating System. ROS was 
selected because the interface allows developers to implement techniques such as advanced perception, object recognition, and 3D bounding of objects for 
working with picking and placing complex objects. We utilize the service of MoveIt which is an open-source robotic manipulation platform that allows developers 
to develop complex manipulation applications using ROS. Through MoveIt, developers can implement and simulate motion planning, manipulation, inverse kinematics, 
control, 3D perception, and collision checking. We utilize the services of the Gazebo simulator and the RViz visualizer to simulate and analyze the task 
implementation done by our robot model, the UR5 robot designed by Universal Robots.
